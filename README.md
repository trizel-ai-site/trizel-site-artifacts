# TRIZEL — Layer-2 Presentation Repository

## Repository Classification

This repository is **Layer-2** in the TRIZEL three-layer architecture.

**This repository contains NO scientific content.**

**Nothing in this repository constitutes a scientific publication.**

## Three-Layer Architecture

The TRIZEL system operates under a strict three-layer separation model:

### Layer-0: Governance / Authority
- **Repository:** [trizel-core](https://github.com/trizel-ai-site/trizel-core)
- **Role:** Establishes policies, standards, and governance framework
- **Authority:** Final decision-making power
- **Status:** Authoritative and binding

### Layer-1: Internal Research & Analysis
- **Repositories:** 
  - [trizel-lab](https://github.com/trizel-ai-site/trizel-lab) — Research documentation
  - trizel-AI — Internal research systems
  - trizel-monitor — Analysis tools
- **Role:** Conducts research, analysis, and validation
- **Authority:** Scientific and technical execution
- **Status:** Internal research operations

### Layer-2: Presentation / Display
- **Repository:** This repository (trizel-site)
- **Role:** Public-facing presentation and orientation
- **Authority:** **NONE**
- **Status:** Presentation-only, read-only, explanatory

## Layer-2 Scope and Constraints

This repository is **strictly limited** to presentation functions:

### Allowed Content
- Structural descriptions
- Navigation aids
- Public orientation materials
- References to authoritative Layer-0 and Layer-1 resources

### Explicit Prohibitions
- No scientific authority
- No research role
- No execution capabilities
- No analysis functions
- No validation activities
- No AI logic or models
- No scientific claims
- No theories or hypotheses
- No results or findings
- No experiments or datasets
- No interpretation of research

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **presentation-only** interface for public stakeholders to:
- Understand the TRIZEL system structure
- Navigate to authoritative resources
- Access formal documentation

**Non-scientific** — This repository does not produce, validate, or interpret any research.

**No publication** — Nothing here is intended for scientific citation.

**No citation** — Materials in this repository are not citable as research.

**No results** — This repository contains no experimental or analytical results.

**No authority** — Layer-2 has no decision-making or interpretative power.

## Governance / Contract

All website content and presentation decisions are governed by the canonical **[Scientific Presentation Contract](docs/SCIENTIFIC_PRESENTATION_CONTRACT.md)**, which establishes the authoritative rules for what is allowed, what is forbidden, and how content must be represented on the TRIZEL public website.

## Multilingual Support

This site is available in five languages with full semantic equivalence:

- **English (EN)** — Canonical source of truth
- **French (FR)** — Français
- **Arabic (AR)** — العربية (RTL layout)
- **Chinese (ZH)** — 中文
- **Russian (RU)** — Русский

All translations maintain scientific and institutional accuracy. The root page (`/`) provides language selection, and each language version includes an integrated language switcher.

### Technical Implementation

- **RTL Support:** Full right-to-left layout for Arabic using CSS logical properties
- **Typography:** Language-specific font stacks for optimal readability
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AAA-compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Architecture:** Static HTML/CSS with minimal JavaScript for language switching only

**JavaScript Usage**: The site includes 88 lines of JavaScript for language switching functionality. This is the governance-approved minimum necessary for multilingual presentation. See [docs/GOVERNANCE_CLARIFICATION.md](docs/GOVERNANCE_CLARIFICATION.md) for explicit justification and scope boundaries.
