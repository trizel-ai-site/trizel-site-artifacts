## Repository Classification

**Phase F — Interactive & AI-Assisted Scientific Observatory**

This repository is **Layer-2** in the TRIZEL three-layer architecture, operating in **Phase F mode** as an interactive scientific observatory with AI-assisted navigation.

### Phase F Status Declaration

- ✅ **Interactive UI** — Governed user interaction within strict boundaries
- ✅ **AI-Assisted** — "Talk to TRIZEL-AI" UI assistant for navigation and explanation
- ✅ **Snapshot-Based** — All content remains frozen institutional documentation
- ✅ **Governance-Controlled** — Updates require Layer-0 approval
- ✅ **UI-Only Interaction** — No execution, no analysis, no live data

**See [PHASE_F_GOVERNANCE.md](PHASE_F_GOVERNANCE.md) for complete Phase F governance framework and AI interaction contract.**

**This repository contains NO scientific content.**

**Nothing in this repository constitutes a scientific publication.**

**This is a presentation-only observatory with ZERO authority.**

## Three-Layer Architecture

The TRIZEL system operates under a strict three-layer separation model:

### Layer-0: Governance / Authority
- **Repository:** External reference only — [trizel-core](https://github.com/trizel-ai-site/trizel-core)
- **Role:** Establishes policies, standards, and governance framework
- **Authority:** Final decision-making power
- **Status:** Authoritative and binding
- **⚠️ Notice:** External reference only — No integration, no execution, no live data

### Layer-1: Internal Research & Analysis
- **Repositories:** External references only
  - [trizel-lab](https://github.com/trizel-ai-site/trizel-lab) — Research documentation (Private)
  - trizel-AI — Internal research systems (Not linked)
  - trizel-monitor — Analysis tools (Not linked)
- **Role:** Conducts research, analysis, and validation
- **Authority:** Scientific and technical execution
- **Status:** Internal research operations
- **⚠️ Notice:** External references only — No access, no integration, no live data

### Layer-2: Presentation / Display
- **Repository:** This repository (trizel-site-artifacts)
- **Phase:** Phase E — Scientific Observatory (Read-Only)
- **Role:** Public-facing presentation and orientation
- **Authority:** **NONE** — Display only, no execution, no analysis
- **Status:** Static presentation, snapshot-based, governance-controlled

## Layer-2 Scope and Constraints (Phase F)

This repository is **limited** to Phase F presentation and interaction functions:

### Allowed Content (Phase F Approved)
- Static structural descriptions
- Navigation aids and orientation materials
- Frozen reference documentation
- External references to authoritative Layer-0 and Layer-1 resources (with disclaimers)
- Conceptual diagrams (static SVG/images only)
- Frozen tables and figures (no dynamic rendering)
- Multilingual institutional documentation
- **Interactive UI elements** (governed under Phase F)
- **"Talk to TRIZEL-AI" assistant** (UI-only, non-authoritative)
- **User interaction** (within strict governance boundaries)

### Explicit Prohibitions (Phase F Enforced)
- ❌ No scientific authority or claims
- ❌ No research role or execution
- ❌ No analysis functions or data processing
- ❌ No validation activities or testing
- ❌ No AI logic, models, or algorithms (in this repository)
- ❌ No scientific theories, hypotheses, or results
- ❌ No experiments, datasets, or live data
- ❌ No interpretation of research findings
- ❌ No pipelines, automation, or CI/CD (beyond validation)
- ❌ No dashboards, analytics, or live data features
- ❌ No integration with execution or analysis systems
- ❌ No AI processing or computation (in this repository)

## Purpose (Phase F Scientific Observatory)

This repository serves as a **Phase F Scientific Observatory** — an interactive, AI-assisted presentation interface for public stakeholders to:
- Navigate the TRIZEL system structure and architecture with AI assistance
- Understand frozen institutional documentation through interactive exploration
- Access external resources with intelligent guidance
- Interact with governance-controlled UI elements
- Engage with the "Talk to TRIZEL-AI" assistant for navigation and explanation

**Phase F Characteristics:**
- **Interactive UI** — Governed user interaction within strict boundaries
- **AI-Assisted** — Single entry point ("Talk to TRIZEL-AI") for UI assistance
- **Snapshot-Based** — All content remains static; no live data or real-time updates
- **Governance-Controlled** — Updates and features require Layer-0 approval
- **UI-Only** — No execution, no analysis, no scientific authority

**Non-scientific** — This repository does not produce, validate, or interpret any research.

**No publication** — Nothing here is intended for scientific citation.

**No citation** — Materials in this repository are not citable as research.

**No results** — This repository contains no experimental or analytical results.

**No authority** — Layer-2 / Phase F has no decision-making or interpretative power.

**No live data** — All content is frozen documentation, not dynamic systems.

## Governance / Contract

All website content and presentation decisions are governed by the canonical **[Scientific Presentation Contract](docs/SCIENTIFIC_PRESENTATION_CONTRACT.md)**, which establishes the authoritative rules for what is allowed, what is forbidden, and how content must be represented on the TRIZEL public website.

## Multilingual Support

This site is available in five languages with full semantic equivalence:

- **English (EN)** — Canonical source of truth
- **French (FR)** — Français
- **Arabic (AR)** — العربية (RTL layout)
- **Chinese (ZH)** — 中文
- **Russian (RU)** — Русский

All translations maintain scientific and institutional accuracy. The root page (`/`) provides language selection, and each language version includes an integrated language switcher.

### Technical Implementation

- **RTL Support:** Full right-to-left layout for Arabic using CSS logical properties
- **Typography:** Language-specific font stacks for optimal readability
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AAA-compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Architecture:** Static HTML/CSS with minimal JavaScript for language switching only

**JavaScript Usage**: The site includes 88 lines of JavaScript for language switching functionality. This is the governance-approved minimum necessary for multilingual presentation. See [docs/GOVERNANCE_CLARIFICATION.md](docs/GOVERNANCE_CLARIFICATION.md) for explicit justification and scope boundaries.
