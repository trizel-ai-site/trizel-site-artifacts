# LAYER BOUNDARIES

## Three-Layer Separation Model

The TRIZEL system operates under a mandatory three-layer architecture with strict separation of concerns and authorities.

## Layer Definitions

### Layer-0: Governance / Authority
- **Repository:** trizel-core
- **Role:** Governance and policy establishment
- **Authority:** Final decision-making power
- **Function:** Defines standards, policies, and constraints
- **Status:** Authoritative and binding

### Layer-1: Internal Research & Analysis
- **Repositories:** trizel-lab, trizel-AI, trizel-monitor
- **Role:** Research execution and analysis
- **Authority:** Scientific and technical operations
- **Function:** Conducts experiments, produces results, performs validation
- **Status:** Internal research and development

### Layer-2: Presentation / Display
- **Repository:** trizel-site (this repository)
- **Role:** Public-facing presentation
- **Authority:** **NONE**
- **Function:** Descriptive orientation and navigation only
- **Status:** **Presentation-only, read-only, explanatory**

## Authority Flow

The authority hierarchy flows strictly from Layer-0 through Layer-1 to Layer-2:

```
Layer-0 (trizel-core)
   ↓ [governs]
Layer-1 (trizel-lab, trizel-AI, trizel-monitor)
   ↓ [informs]
Layer-2 (trizel-site)
```

### Decision Authority
- **Layer-0 decides** — Establishes policies and constraints
- **Layer-1 produces** — Executes research under Layer-0 governance
- **Layer-2 displays** — Presents structural information only

## Layer-2 Constraints

**Layer-2 has NO authority and NO interpretative power.**

Layer-2 is **prohibited** from:
- Making scientific claims
- Interpreting research results
- Establishing policies or standards
- Executing analysis or validation
- Publishing citable research
- Producing authoritative content
- Making technical decisions
- Validating or verifying research

Layer-2 is **limited** to:
- Describing system structure
- Providing navigation to Layer-0 and Layer-1
- Offering public orientation
- Maintaining institutional presentation

## Separation Enforcement

These boundaries are **non-negotiable** and **immutable**.

**Presentation-only** — Layer-2 content is descriptive only.

**Non-scientific** — Layer-2 contains no research or analysis.

**No authority** — Layer-2 has zero decision-making power.

**No publication** — Layer-2 produces no citable materials.

**No citation** — Layer-2 materials are not research artifacts.

**No results** — Layer-2 publishes no experimental outcomes.

Any violation of these boundaries constitutes a breach of the layer separation model and is strictly prohibited.

## Cross-Layer References

- Layer-2 **may reference** Layer-0 governance documents (read-only)
- Layer-2 **may reference** Layer-1 research repositories (descriptive only)
- Layer-2 **may not modify** Layer-0 or Layer-1 content
- Layer-2 **may not interpret** Layer-1 research findings

## Institutional Compliance

This layer separation model is maintained under institutional governance and is binding across all TRIZEL repositories.
