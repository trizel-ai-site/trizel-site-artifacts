# AI ROLE

## AI Reference in Layer-2

This document defines how AI is referenced within this Layer-2 presentation repository.

## Scope: Descriptive Only

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is **referenced descriptively only** in this repository.

**Presentation-only** — AI is mentioned solely for structural orientation purposes.

**Non-scientific** — No AI research, analysis, or technical implementation exists here.

**No authority** — Layer-2 has no authority over AI systems or operations.

## Explicit Prohibitions

### No AI Models

**PROHIBITED:**
- Deployment of AI models (machine learning, deep learning, etc.)
- Storage of model weights, parameters, or architectures
- Model training, fine-tuning, or optimization
- Model inference or prediction
- Model evaluation or validation
- Model versioning or distribution

**No execution** — Layer-2 does not operate AI models.

### No Agents

**PROHIBITED:**
- Deployment of AI agents or autonomous systems
- Agent-based decision-making systems
- Multi-agent systems or frameworks
- Agent communication or coordination
- Goal-directed agent behaviors
- Agent learning or adaptation

**No authority** — Layer-2 cannot operate autonomous agents.

### No Autonomy

**PROHIBITED:**
- Autonomous decision-making systems
- Self-directed operations or workflows
- Automated policy enforcement via AI
- Independent system actions
- Unsupervised AI operations
- Autonomous data processing

**No execution** — Layer-2 has no autonomous capabilities.

### No Execution

**PROHIBITED:**
- Execution of AI algorithms or procedures
- Running AI computations or processing
- Real-time AI operations
- Batch processing via AI systems
- AI-powered analysis or transformation
- Computational AI workflows

**No results** — Layer-2 produces no AI-generated outputs.

### No Inference

**PROHIBITED:**
- Inference operations (predictions, classifications, etc.)
- Real-time inference services
- Batch inference processing
- Inference pipeline execution
- Model serving or deployment
- Inference result generation or distribution

**No authority** — Layer-2 cannot validate or produce inferences.

### No Control

**PROHIBITED:**
- Control of AI systems or operations
- Management of AI infrastructure
- Configuration of AI services
- Orchestration of AI workflows
- Monitoring or supervision of AI execution
- Governance of AI decision-making

**No authority** — Layer-2 has no control over AI systems.

## Permitted References

Layer-2 **may** reference AI in the following strictly limited contexts:

### Descriptive Mentions
- Stating that AI research occurs in Layer-1
- Describing the layer separation model for AI operations
- Providing navigation to Layer-1 AI research repositories
- Explaining institutional structure related to AI governance

### Navigation Only
- Links to Layer-0 governance of AI policies
- Links to Layer-1 AI research repositories
- References to authoritative AI documentation in other layers

**Presentation-only** — All AI references are descriptive and navigational only.

**Non-scientific** — No AI research content or technical details are included.

**No authority** — Layer-2 does not interpret or assess AI capabilities.

## Terminology Enforcement

When AI is mentioned, the following terms must be consistently used:

- **Descriptively only**
- **Presentation-only**
- **Non-scientific**
- **No execution**
- **No authority**
- **No results**
- **No publication**

## Compliance

Any AI-related content or operations that violate these constraints constitute a breach of Layer-2 boundaries and are strictly prohibited.

**No AI models** — Layer-2 does not deploy models.

**No agents** — Layer-2 does not operate agents.

**No autonomy** — Layer-2 has no autonomous systems.

**No execution** — Layer-2 does not run AI operations.

**No inference** — Layer-2 does not produce predictions or classifications.

**No control** — Layer-2 does not manage AI infrastructure.
