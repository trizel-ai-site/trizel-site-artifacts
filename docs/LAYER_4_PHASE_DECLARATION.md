# LAYER-4 PHASE DECLARATION

## Classification

**Layer:** Layer-4 (System Interface & Narrative Surface)  
**Status:** DECLARED (Not Implemented)  
**Date:** 2026-01-19  
**Purpose:** Narrative structure, explanatory UI, and guided user understanding

---

## Authoritative Declaration

This document formally declares **Layer-4** as a governance-approved future phase for the TRIZEL system.

**Layer-4 is a DECLARATION-ONLY phase.**

**Layer-4 is NOT implemented.**

All authority for this declaration derives from **Layer-0 (trizel-core)**.

---

## What is Layer-4?

Layer-4 introduces **System Interface concepts** that enable:

- **Narrative structure** — Guided storytelling for system understanding
- **Explanatory UI** — Context-aware guidance and explanation
- **User understanding** — Progressive disclosure and educational interfaces
- **Interface role** — Changes the ROLE of the web surface, not its behavior

**Purpose:** Layer-4 provides **NARRATIVE AND INTERFACE STRUCTURE**, not operational systems.

---

## Critical Declaration

**THIS IS A PHASE DECLARATION ONLY.**

Layer-4 changes the **conceptual role** of the web surface without implementing functional systems, logic, or interaction.

**No UI exists. No interface is functional. No narrative is displayed.**

Any implementation requires a future Phase (e.g., Layer-4.1) with separate governance approval.

---

## Scope and Purpose

### Layer-4 Declares

- **Narrative boundaries** — What storytelling is allowed vs forbidden
- **Interface principles** — System Interface concepts for future implementation
- **Guided understanding** — Educational and explanatory UI concepts
- **Role transformation** — How Layer-4 changes the web surface's purpose
- **Separation boundaries** — Explicit distinction from Display (Layer-2), Epistemic mapping (Layer-2.5), and Topology (Layer-3)

### Layer-4 Does NOT Provide

- Functional UI or interaction
- Implemented pages or components
- JavaScript logic or behavior
- Data integration (live or static)
- Mockups, wireframes, or placeholders
- Preparation for execution
- Integration with Layer-1 repositories
- Operational systems of any kind
- TODOs or future implementation hints

---

## Explicit Constraints

### ALLOWED in Layer-4 Declaration

- Documentation of future interface concepts
- Definition of narrative boundaries
- Specification of System Interface principles
- Description of allowed UI concepts
- Declaration of purpose and scope
- Governance-aligned policy statements

### PROHIBITED in Layer-4 Declaration

**Absolutely NO:**

- UI changes of any kind
- HTML, CSS, or JavaScript modifications
- New pages or components
- Interaction logic or behavior
- Data (live, static, or mockup)
- Wireframes, placeholders, or mockups
- Preparation code or scaffolding
- Integration with any repository
- Implementation of any system
- TODOs or speculative execution language
- Future placeholders implying execution
- Bypass of surface-freeze policies
- Files outside `/docs` directory

---

## Layer Separation Compliance

Layer-4 maintains strict separation from existing layers:

```
Layer-0 (trizel-core)
   ↓ [governs]
Layer-1 (trizel-lab, trizel-AI, trizel-monitor)
   ↓ [informs]
Layer-2 (trizel-site — presentation pages)
   ↓ [extends with]
Layer-2.5 (atlas/ — epistemic mapping)
   ↓ [extends with]
Layer-3 (topology/ — system linking)
   ↓ [extends with]
Layer-4 (FUTURE — system interface & narrative)
```

**Layer-4 is a conceptual extension of Layer-2's presentation functions.**

Layer-4 shares the same fundamental constraints as Layer-2, Layer-2.5, and Layer-3:
- **Presentation-only** (when implemented)
- **No scientific content**
- **No authority**
- **No publication value**
- **No citation**
- **No execution** (when implemented)

---

## What Layer-4 Changes

### Layer-4 Transforms the Web Surface Role

**Current Role** (Layer-2, Layer-2.5, Layer-3):
- Institutional display
- Structural navigation
- Epistemic mapping
- System topology visualization
- Non-directive presentation

**Future Role** (Layer-4 when implemented):
- **Narrative guidance** — Storytelling for understanding
- **Explanatory interface** — Contextual help and education
- **Progressive disclosure** — Guided learning paths
- **User-centered design** — Interface optimized for comprehension
- **System interface** — Active guidance, not passive display

**Critical Distinction**: Layer-4 does not change what is displayed (data, topology, structure). It changes **how users understand** what is displayed through narrative and interface design.

---

## Non-Authority Declaration

**Layer-4 has NO authority.**

All content in Layer-4 (when implemented) will be:
- **Non-scientific** — Contains no research or analysis
- **Non-authoritative** — Makes no decisions or interpretations
- **Non-executable** — Contains no logic or processing (beyond presentation interaction)
- **Non-operational** — Performs no system functions
- **Explanatory-only** — Guides understanding, does not produce knowledge

**All authority derives from Layer-0 (trizel-core).**

---

## File Structure

Layer-4 Phase Declaration consists of documentation only:

```
/docs/
  LAYER_4_PHASE_DECLARATION.md    (This file — authoritative declaration)
  SYSTEM_INTERFACE_PRINCIPLES.md  (Interface concepts and boundaries)
  NARRATIVE_BOUNDARIES.md          (Allowed vs forbidden storytelling)
```

**No files outside `/docs` directory.**

**No implementation files of any kind.**

---

## Implementation Policy

**Layer-4 is NOT implemented in this Phase.**

Future implementation of Layer-4 requires:
- Separate governance approval
- Distinct Phase designation (e.g., Layer-4.1)
- Explicit execution authority
- Compliance with narrative boundaries
- Adherence to System Interface principles
- Preservation of Layer-2, Layer-2.5, and Layer-3 frozen state

**This Phase declares the conceptual space. It does not execute within it.**

---

## Immutability Constraints

Layer-4 Declaration **MUST NOT** modify or interfere with:

- **Layer-0 (trizel-core)** — Governance authority
- **Layer-1 (trizel-lab, trizel-AI, trizel-monitor)** — Research systems
- **Layer-2 (presentation pages)** — Existing presentation content
- **Layer-2.5 (atlas/)** — Epistemic mapping interface
- **Layer-3 (topology/)** — System topology and linking

**Layer-2, Layer-2.5, and Layer-3 remain frozen and untouched.**

---

## Multilingual Support

Layer-4 (when implemented) will maintain i18n parity with existing layers:

- **English (EN)** — Canonical reference
- **French (FR)** — Français
- **Arabic (AR)** — العربية (RTL layout)
- **Chinese (ZH)** — 中文
- **Russian (RU)** — Русский

All narrative and interface guidance will be translated with semantic equivalence.

---

## UI Design Philosophy

Layer-4 (when implemented) will follow institutional design standards with narrative extension:

- **Neutral foundation** — Maintains institutional credibility
- **Narrative guidance** — Adds storytelling for understanding
- **Non-directive** — Guides without manipulation
- **Educational** — Supports learning and comprehension
- **Accessible** — WCAG AAA compliant where applicable
- **Progressive** — Adapts to user understanding level

**Visual polish is allowed to support narrative clarity and user guidance.**

---

## Governance Alignment

Layer-4 is governed by the same framework as Layer-2, Layer-2.5, and Layer-3:

- Subordinate to Layer-0 (trizel-core)
- References Layer-1, Layer-2, Layer-2.5, and Layer-3 for context
- Maintains layer boundary separation
- Complies with TRIZEL governance framework

**This is NOT a new layer in the governance sense.** It is an extension of Layer-2's presentation functions with narrative and interface concepts.

---

## Execution Policy

**Layer-4 is a PHASE DECLARATION, not a system implementation.**

This Phase:
- **Declares** the scope and purpose of Layer-4
- **Defines** what Layer-4 is and is NOT
- **Establishes** narrative boundaries and constraints
- **Specifies** System Interface principles

This Phase does NOT:
- Implement UI or interfaces
- Execute narrative or storytelling
- Integrate with data sources
- Provide functional systems
- Create placeholders or mockups
- Prepare for execution
- Bypass surface-freeze policies

---

## CI and Validation Requirements

Layer-4 Declaration must pass all existing CI checks:

- No bypass of surface-freeze policies
- No modification of existing layers
- Compliance with governance constraints
- No files outside `/docs` directory
- No introduction of implementation elements
- No speculative language or TODOs

**All existing checks must pass without modification.**

---

## Deliverable Summary

**Single PR containing:**

1. Phase declaration documentation (this file)
2. System Interface principles documentation
3. Narrative boundaries documentation

**No TODOs. No speculative content. No future placeholders.**

**No implementation. No UI. No behavior.**
