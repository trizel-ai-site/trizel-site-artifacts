# SCIENTIFIC_PRESENTATION_CONTRACT  
## TRIZEL — Official Scientific Presentation Surface

**Status:** Canonical  
**Scope:** Public Scientific Website (Layer-UI / Presentation)  
**Authority:** `trizel-core` (Layer-0 Governance)  
**Applies to:** `trizel-ai-site / trizel-site`  
**Audience:** Scientific, Institutional, Regulatory, Archival  

---

## 1. Purpose of This Contract

This document defines **what is allowed, what is forbidden, and how content must be represented** on the official TRIZEL public website.

The website is **not a product**, **not a tool**, and **not an interface for execution**.  
It is a **scientific presentation surface** whose sole purpose is:

> To *explain*, *situate*, and *document* the TRIZEL system and its validated scientific components with full epistemic traceability.

This contract overrides all UI, design, or implementation preferences.

---

## 2. Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

**Nothing appears on the website unless it satisfies all of the following:**

1. It is **scientifically defined**
2. It has a **clear functional role** in the TRIZEL system
3. Its **authority and layer** are explicitly stated
4. It introduces **no new meaning**, **no behavior**, and **no implied interaction**
5. It is **traceable** to a canonical source (repository, DOI, or governance document)

---

## 3. Website Role by Layer

### Layer Classification of the Website

| Layer | Meaning on Website |
|------|-------------------|
| Layer-0 | **Referenced only** (governance authority, never duplicated) |
| Layer-1 | **Described, never exposed** |
| Layer-2 | **Displayed as approved artifacts** |
| Layer-3 | **Explained structurally** |
| Layer-4 | **Narrative & institutional explanation only** |

The website itself is **not part of the execution pipeline**.

---

## 4. What the Website IS

The website **IS**:

- A **scientific institutional gateway**
- A **navigation surface** for understanding the TRIZEL system
- A **registry of validated components**
- A **documentation index** for approved artifacts
- A **neutral explanatory layer**, comparable to ESA / NASA institutional sites

---

## 5. What the Website IS NOT

The website is **NOT**:

- ❌ An application
- ❌ A dashboard
- ❌ A control panel
- ❌ A monitoring interface
- ❌ A data browser
- ❌ A research lab
- ❌ A substitute for repositories
- ❌ A place for experimental content

No exceptions.

---

## 6. Repository Representation Rules

### 6.1 Repositories Are Never Shown as "Repos"

On the website:

- Repository names are **never the primary object**
- GitHub is treated as an **implementation detail**, not the system itself

Each repository must be represented as:

> **A scientific function**, not a code container

---

### 6.2 Mandatory Representation Format

Every system component must be presented as:

1. **Scientific Name** (human-readable)
2. **Functional Role** (what it does, scientifically)
3. **Layer Position**
4. **Authority / Governance Source**
5. **Status** (active, internal, archival, experimental)
6. **External References** (GitHub, DOI, Zenodo — if applicable)

Example (conceptual):

> **AUTO DZ ACT — Epistemic State Validation Algorithm**  
> Layer: Methodological Core  
> Role: Detection and validation of zero-state transitions  
> Status: Scientifically defined, non-theoretical  
> Authority: Published methodology (Zenodo DOI)  
> Implementation Reference: GitHub (secondary)

---

## 7. Logos & Visual Identity

### 7.1 Logos Are Scientific Identifiers

A logo (TRIZEL, AUTO DZ ACT, etc.) is treated as:

- A **registered scientific identity**
- A **methodological marker**
- Not a decorative asset

Rules:

- Logos appear **only once per scientific entity**
- Logos **must not imply productization**
- Logos **must be accompanied by scientific description**
- No marketing usage, no emphasis effects, no animations

---

## 8. Automation & "T تلقائية" — Explicitly Forbidden

The following are **explicitly forbidden** on the website:

- ❌ Automatic aggregation of repositories
- ❌ Live syncing of GitHub metadata
- ❌ Stars, forks, commit counts
- ❌ "Latest update" indicators
- ❌ Dynamic content generation
- ❌ Any form of runtime logic

Reason:

> Automation breaks epistemic traceability and introduces uncontrolled semantic drift.

All content is **manually curated, validated, and frozen**.

---

## 9. Account & Organization Separation

### Personal Account (`abdelkader-omran`)
- Represents **research activity**
- Contains:
  - Data pipelines
  - Analysis tools
  - Monitoring systems
- **Never mirrored directly on the website**

### Institutional Account (`trizel-ai`)
- Represents **system components**
- Contains:
  - Governance
  - Algorithms
  - Engines
  - Gateways

### Website Account (`trizel-ai-site`)
- Represents **public scientific presentation**
- Contains:
  - Static content only
  - No logic
  - No execution
  - No inference

---

## 10. Approval & Change Control

Any of the following **requires explicit governance approval**:

- Adding a new page
- Adding a new system component
- Adding a logo
- Changing wording of scientific descriptions
- Introducing a new layer narrative

Approval authority: **Layer-0 (`trizel-core`)**

---

## 11. Enforcement Rule

If a conflict arises between:

- UI aesthetics  
- Developer convenience  
- Platform limitations  

**This contract wins. Always.**

---

## 12. Final Statement

> The TRIZEL website is a **scientific institution in digital form**.  
> It must behave like an archive, not a product;  
> like a charter, not a tool;  
> like an agency site, not a startup landing page.

Any deviation from this contract is considered **a scientific misrepresentation**, not a technical issue.
