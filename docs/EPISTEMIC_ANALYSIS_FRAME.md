# EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME

## Classification

**Layer-1 Epistemic Analysis Record TEMPLATE (Non-Operational)**

This is a meta-governance artifact providing terminology standards only.

## Governance Disclaimer

**NO LAYER-1 ACTIVITY IS INITIATED** — This document does not activate, execute, or authorize any epistemic analysis operations.

**NO EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED** — This is a definition template only, not an operational record.

**NO AUTHORIZATION IS CONSUMED** — No Layer-1 resources or permissions are used by this document.

**REUSABLE TEMPLATE ONLY** — This file serves as a reference definition for future authorized Layer-1 records.

**NON-EXECUTABLE** — This document contains no executable logic or operational instructions.

**NON-BINDING** — This template does not constitute an authorization or approval for Layer-1 operations.

**REQUIRES FUTURE AUTHORIZED PR** — Any actual Layer-1 epistemic analysis requires separate governance approval and explicit authorization via a dedicated PR.

## Governance Authority

This template is governed by and references **TRIZEL_GOVERNANCE_LEDGER.md** as the authoritative source for Layer-1 operations governance.

**This PR is NOT registered as a governance or analysis event** — It is a terminology compliance update only.

## Definition

**EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME**: A governance-compliant analytical framework designed to evaluate, compare, and stress-test physical hypotheses without presupposing General Relativity or Newtonian mechanics, enabling controlled epistemic validation through AUTO DZ ACT within an internal laboratory context.

## Layer-2 Presentation Context

This document provides the standard definition of EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME for governance and terminology compliance purposes.

**Presentation-only** — This definition is provided for structural orientation only.

**Non-scientific** — This repository contains no research implementation or validation of the framework.

**No authority** — Layer-2 has no authority over the framework's scientific execution.

## Terminology Governance

The term **EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME** is the governance-approved terminology for analytical frameworks within the TRIZEL system.

**Deprecated terminology**: Previous terminology is no longer compliant and must not be used in place of EPISTEMIC ANALYSIS FRAME.

## References

- **Governance Authority**: Layer-0 (trizel-core) establishes terminology standards
- **Research Implementation**: Layer-1 (trizel-lab) conducts epistemic analysis operations

## Scope Constraints

Layer-2 presentation constraints apply:
- No execution of epistemic analysis
- No validation activities
- No research interpretation
- No scientific claims
- Descriptive reference only
