# PRESENTATION SCOPE

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **public orientation layer only**. Its sole function is to provide structural information and navigation guidance to external stakeholders.

**Presentation-only** — All content is descriptive and non-authoritative.

**Non-scientific** — This repository contains no research, analysis, or scientific content.

## Allowed Content

Layer-2 presentation content is strictly limited to:

### Descriptive Materials
- System structure descriptions
- Layer boundary explanations
- Navigation and orientation aids
- References to authoritative sources (Layer-0, Layer-1)

### Navigation Elements
- Links to governance repositories (Layer-0)
- Links to research repositories (Layer-1)
- Structural documentation
- Public-facing orientation materials

### Structural Information
- Repository organization descriptions
- Layer architecture explanations
- Scope and constraint documentation
- Institutional notices

## Explicit Exclusions

The following content types are **explicitly prohibited** in this repository:

### Scientific Content
- Research findings or results
- Experimental data or datasets
- Scientific theories or hypotheses
- Scientific methodologies
- Analytical procedures
- Validation processes
- Research interpretations

### Technical Execution
- Models (mathematical, computational, or AI)
- Algorithms or implementations
- Data processing logic
- Analysis tools or scripts
- Execution environments
- Computational resources

### Authority and Claims
- Scientific claims or assertions
- Research conclusions
- Technical decisions
- Validation statements
- Quality assessments
- Performance metrics
- Benchmarks or comparisons

### Publication Materials
- DOI assignments
- Zenodo deposits
- Citable research artifacts
- Publication metadata
- Version-controlled results
- Archival research materials

## Constraint Enforcement

**No authority** — Layer-2 has no decision-making power.

**No results** — This repository publishes no research outcomes.

**No publication** — Nothing here constitutes a scientific publication.

**No citation** — Materials are not intended for citation.

All content must remain **presentation-only**, **non-scientific**, and **descriptive**.

## Compliance

This document defines the mandatory boundaries for Layer-2 presentation content. Any deviation from these constraints violates the layer separation model and is prohibited.
