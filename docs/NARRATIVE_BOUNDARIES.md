## Implementation Governance

### When Narrative May Be Implemented

Narrative implementation requires:

1. **Governance Approval** — Explicit authorization from Layer-0
2. **Phase Designation** — Distinct execution phase (e.g., Layer-4.1)
3. **Boundary Compliance** — Adherence to all boundaries in this document
4. **Principle Compliance** — Adherence to SYSTEM_INTERFACE_PRINCIPLES.md
5. **Review Process** — Pre-implementation narrative review

### Narrative Review Checklist

Before implementation, all narrative content must be reviewed for:

- [ ] No marketing language
- [ ] No authority claims
- [ ] No emotional manipulation
- [ ] No future promises
- [ ] No scientific interpretations
- [ ] Educational purpose clear
- [ ] Institutional tone maintained
- [ ] Layer boundaries respected

## Relationship to Layer-0 Governance

**All narrative boundaries are subordinate to Layer-0.**

Layer-0 (trizel-core) may:
- Override these boundaries
- Provide additional restrictions
- Authorize specific exceptions
- Revise narrative policy

**Layer-4 narrative makes no governance decisions.**

---

## Evolution and Amendment

### These Boundaries May Be Updated When:

- Layer-0 provides new guidance
- Implementation reveals ambiguities
- New narrative patterns require definition
- User feedback reveals boundary issues

### These Boundaries May NOT Be Relaxed For:

- User engagement optimization
- Marketing or promotional goals
- Competitive differentiation
- Modern UX trends

**Institutional neutrality is non-negotiable.**

---

## Summary

**Narrative Boundaries define:**

1. **Allowed storytelling** — Educational, structural, neutral
2. **Forbidden storytelling** — Marketing, emotional, authoritative
3. **Tone requirements** — Institutional, educational, transparent
4. **Content boundaries** — Structure description, not interpretation
5. **Validation criteria** — Educational, neutral, factual, optional

**These are conceptual boundaries for future implementation, not current narratives.**

---

## Institutional Notice

**Non-scientific** — Contains no research or analysis.

**Non-authoritative** — Makes no governance decisions.

**Non-operational** — Describes boundaries, not implemented narratives.

**Declarative** — Establishes constraints for future phases.
