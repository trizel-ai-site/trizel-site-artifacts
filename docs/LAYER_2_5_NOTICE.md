# LAYER-2.5 NOTICE

## Classification

**Layer:** Layer-2.5 (System Interface / Epistemic Atlas)  
**Status:** Read-only, display-only, non-authoritative  
**Date:** 2026-01-19  
**Purpose:** Static epistemic overview of TRIZEL system components

---

## What is Layer-2.5?

Layer-2.5 introduces a **System Interface** called the **Epistemic Atlas**. This interface provides a **static, read-only mapping** of the TRIZEL system's epistemic structure, including:

- Evidence artifacts
- Publications
- Repositories
- Relationships between components

**Presentation-only** — This interface displays structural information without performing analysis, inference, or execution.

---

## Scope and Constraints

### Allowed Functions
- **Display** static relationships between system components
- **Reference** authoritative Layer-0 and Layer-1 sources
- **Map** repository → artifact → evidence relationships
- **Present** epistemic overview for human understanding

### Explicit Prohibitions
Layer-2.5 **MUST NOT**:
- Perform analysis or inference
- Execute logic or algorithms
- Integrate live data or APIs
- Communicate with Layer-1 repositories
- Make scientific claims
- Interpret research results
- Validate or verify data
- Process dynamic information

---

## Non-Authority Declaration

**Layer-2.5 has NO authority.**

All content in Layer-2.5 is:
- **Non-scientific** — Contains no research or analysis
- **Non-authoritative** — Makes no decisions or interpretations
- **Non-executable** — Contains no logic or processing
- **Read-only** — Displays pre-validated static data only

**All authority derives from Layer-0 (trizel-core).**

---

## Layer Separation Compliance

Layer-2.5 maintains strict separation from other layers:

```
Layer-0 (trizel-core)
   ↓ [governs]
Layer-1 (trizel-lab, trizel-AI, trizel-monitor)
   ↓ [informs]
Layer-2 (trizel-site — presentation pages)
   ↓ [extends with]
Layer-2.5 (atlas/ — epistemic mapping)
```

**Layer-2.5 is an extension of Layer-2**, sharing the same constraints:
- Presentation-only
- No scientific content
- No authority
- No publication value
- No citation

---

## File Structure

Layer-2.5 consists of the following files only:

```
/atlas/
  index.html          (Language selector for Atlas)
  map.json            (Static validated relationships)
  sources.json        (Repository → Artifact → Evidence references)
  en/index.html       (English Atlas interface)
  fr/index.html       (French Atlas interface)
  ar/index.html       (Arabic Atlas interface — RTL)
  zh/index.html       (Chinese Atlas interface)
  ru/index.html       (Russian Atlas interface)

/docs/
  LAYER_2_5_NOTICE.md (This file — scope and constraints)
  ATLAS_SCHEMA.md     (Schema documentation)
```

---

## Data Validation

All data in Layer-2.5 is:
- **Pre-validated** — Validated at Layer-0 or Layer-1 before inclusion
- **Static** — No dynamic updates or live data
- **Read-only** — No modification capabilities
- **Structural** — Relationships only, no interpretations

**Layer-2.5 does NOT perform validation.** It only displays pre-validated data.

---

## Multilingual Support

Layer-2.5 maintains full i18n parity with Layer-2:
- **English (EN)** — Canonical
- **French (FR)** — Français
- **Arabic (AR)** — العربية (RTL layout)
- **Chinese (ZH)** — 中文
- **Russian (RU)** — Русский

All translations are semantically equivalent and non-interpretative.

---

## UI Design Principles

Layer-2.5 follows institutional design standards:
- **Neutral** — No storytelling or marketing
- **Scientific** — Institutional and objective
- **Non-directive** — No implied interpretations
- **RTL-ready** — Full support for Arabic
- **Accessible** — WCAG AAA compliant

**No animations** that imply interpretation or analysis.

---

## Governance Alignment

Layer-2.5 is governed by the same policies as Layer-2:
- Subordinate to Layer-0 (trizel-core)
- References Layer-1 (trizel-lab) for research artifacts
- Maintains layer boundary separation
- Complies with TRIZEL governance framework

**This is NOT a new layer in the governance sense.** It is an extension of Layer-2's presentation functions.

---

## Institutional Notice

**Non-scientific** — Layer-2.5 contains no research content.

**No publication** — Materials are not citable or publishable.

**No authority** — Layer-2.5 has zero decision-making power.

**No citation** — Content is not intended for scientific citation.

**No results** — Layer-2.5 publishes no experimental outcomes.

**Display-only** — All content is presentation-only.

**Layer-2.5** — System Interface — Epistemic Atlas — Display-only — Non-authoritative — No analysis
