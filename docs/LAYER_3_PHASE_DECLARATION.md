# LAYER-3 PHASE DECLARATION

## Classification

**Layer:** Layer-3 (System Linking & Repository Topology)  
**Status:** READ-ONLY, display-only, non-operational  
**Date:** 2026-01-19  
**Purpose:** System topology visibility and repository linking

---

## Authoritative Declaration

This document formally declares **Layer-3** as a governance-approved phase for the TRIZEL system.

**Layer-3 is a READ-ONLY system-level linking phase.**

All authority for this declaration derives from **Layer-0 (trizel-core)**.

---

## What is Layer-3?

Layer-3 introduces **explicit, non-operational connections** between:

- **GitHub Accounts** — Individual and organizational accounts
- **Organizations** — GitHub organizations within the TRIZEL ecosystem
- **Repositories** — All TRIZEL repositories across layers
- **Layers** — Layer-0, Layer-1, Layer-2, and Layer-2.5

**Purpose:** Layer-3 provides **SYSTEM TOPOLOGY VISIBILITY**, not execution.

---

## Scope and Purpose

### Layer-3 Provides

- **Static mapping** of repository relationships
- **Organizational structure** visibility
- **Account associations** with repositories
- **Cross-layer references** for navigation
- **System-level overview** of TRIZEL topology

### Layer-3 Does NOT Provide

- Live data or dynamic updates
- Repository introspection
- Metadata fetching
- API integration
- Analytics or metrics
- Search or filter capabilities
- Timelines or historical data
- Interactive features
- Inference or execution logic

---

## Explicit Constraints

### ALLOWED in Layer-3

- Static documentation of repository relationships
- Hand-authored topology data
- Visual presentation of system structure
- References to GitHub accounts and organizations
- Cross-references to Layer-0, Layer-1, Layer-2, and Layer-2.5
- Minimal visual polish for clarity

### PROHIBITED in Layer-3

**Absolutely NO:**

- Live data integration
- API calls or dynamic fetching
- Repository introspection or metadata queries
- Analytics or statistics
- Search, filters, or query interfaces
- Timelines or activity tracking
- Execution logic or system behavior
- Inference or interpretation
- Integration with Layer-1 systems (lab, models, monitor)
- Operational UI elements
- Dashboards or monitoring interfaces
- Dynamic graphs or visualizations
- Automation or scripting
- Future placeholders implying execution

---

## Layer Separation Compliance

Layer-3 maintains strict separation from other layers:

```
Layer-0 (trizel-core)
   ↓ [governs]
Layer-1 (trizel-lab, trizel-AI, trizel-monitor)
   ↓ [informs]
Layer-2 (trizel-site — presentation pages)
   ↓ [extends with]
Layer-2.5 (atlas/ — epistemic mapping)
   ↓ [extends with]
Layer-3 (topology/ — system linking)
```

**Layer-3 is an extension of Layer-2's presentation functions.**

Layer-3 shares the same constraints as Layer-2 and Layer-2.5:
- **Presentation-only**
- **No scientific content**
- **No authority**
- **No publication value**
- **No citation**
- **No execution**

---

## Non-Authority Declaration

**Layer-3 has NO authority.**

All content in Layer-3 is:
- **Non-scientific** — Contains no research or analysis
- **Non-authoritative** — Makes no decisions or interpretations
- **Non-executable** — Contains no logic or processing
- **Non-operational** — Performs no system functions
- **Read-only** — Displays pre-validated static data only

**All authority derives from Layer-0 (trizel-core).**

---

## File Structure

Layer-3 consists of the following files only:

```
/topology/
  index.html          (Static system topology page)
  topology.json       (Static, hand-authored relationships)

/docs/
  LAYER_3_PHASE_DECLARATION.md  (This file — authoritative declaration)
  SYSTEM_TOPOLOGY.md            (System topology documentation)
  LINKING_RULES.md              (Linking semantics and constraints)
```

**No additional files or directories.**

---

## Data Validation

All data in Layer-3 is:
- **Hand-authored** — Manually created and validated
- **Static** — No dynamic updates or live data
- **Read-only** — No modification capabilities
- **Structural** — Relationships only, no interpretations
- **Pre-validated** — Validated at creation time

**Layer-3 does NOT perform validation.** It only displays pre-validated data.

---

## Immutability Constraints

Layer-3 **MUST NOT** modify or interfere with:

- **Layer-0 (trizel-core)** — Governance authority
- **Layer-1 (trizel-lab, trizel-AI, trizel-monitor)** — Research systems
- **Layer-2 (presentation pages)** — Existing presentation content
- **Layer-2.5 (atlas/)** — Epistemic mapping interface

**Layer-2 and Layer-2.5 remain frozen and untouched.**

---

## Multilingual Support

Layer-3 maintains i18n parity with Layer-2 and Layer-2.5:

- **English (EN)** — Canonical reference
- **French (FR)** — Optional in this phase
- **Arabic (AR)** — Optional in this phase
- **Chinese (ZH)** — Optional in this phase
- **Russian (RU)** — Optional in this phase

English is the reference language for this phase declaration.

---

## UI Design Principles

Layer-3 follows institutional design standards:

- **Neutral** — No storytelling or marketing
- **Scientific** — Institutional and objective
- **Non-directive** — No implied interpretations
- **Minimal** — Only what is necessary for clarity
- **Accessible** — WCAG AAA compliant where applicable
- **Static** — No animations implying execution

**Visual polish is allowed ONLY to support clarity of topology.**

---

## Governance Alignment

Layer-3 is governed by the same policies as Layer-2 and Layer-2.5:

- Subordinate to Layer-0 (trizel-core)
- References Layer-1, Layer-2, and Layer-2.5 for context
- Maintains layer boundary separation
- Complies with TRIZEL governance framework

**This is NOT a new layer in the governance sense.** It is an extension of Layer-2's presentation functions.

---

## Execution Policy

**Layer-3 is a PHASE DECLARATION, not a system implementation.**

This phase:
- **Declares** the scope and purpose of Layer-3
- **Defines** what Layer-3 is and is NOT
- **Establishes** structural boundaries and constraints
- **Provides** static topology visibility

This phase does NOT:
- Implement operational systems
- Execute logic or automation
- Integrate with live data sources
- Provide interactive features

---

## CI and Validation Requirements

Layer-3 must pass all existing CI checks:

- No bypass of surface-freeze policies
- No modification of existing layers
- Compliance with governance constraints
- Validation of static file structure
- No introduction of dynamic elements

**All existing checks must pass without modification.**

---

## Deliverable Summary

**Single PR containing:**

1. Phase declaration documentation (this file)
2. System topology documentation
3. Linking rules documentation
4. Static topology HTML page
5. Static topology JSON data

**No TODOs. No speculative content. No future placeholders.**

---
