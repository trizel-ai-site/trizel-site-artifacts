## Governance Gate Status

This document records the completion status of governance gates for the TRIZEL system as reflected in this publication-support repository.

### Completed Gates

The following governance gates have been completed:

#### Gate 2I
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Scope:** Initial structural validation and repository classification

#### Gate 2I-B
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Scope:** Proof of flow and governance framework establishment

#### Gate 3A
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Scope:** Architectural validation and layer separation enforcement

#### Gate 3B
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Scope:** Publication framework and institutional documentation standards

#### Gate 4A
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Scope:** Execution readiness validation

**Gate 4A Specific Details:**
- **Execution Readiness:** Validated
- **Artifact Classification:** Structural-only DERIVED artifacts
- **Scientific Analysis:** NO scientific analysis produced
- **Repository Role:** Publication-support surface only
- **Constraints:** No execution, no analysis, no live data

Gate 4A establishes execution readiness for downstream processes while maintaining strict separation between execution systems and publication surfaces. All artifacts produced under Gate 4A are structural and declarative, supporting audit and provenance tracking without performing scientific analysis.
