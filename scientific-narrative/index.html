    <h1>TRIZEL</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Scientific Narrative and Institutional Framework</p>

    <div class="institutional-notice">
        <p><strong>Institutional Classification:</strong> This narrative describes the conceptual architecture and governance framework of the TRIZEL system. It contains no scientific data, experimental results, or unpublished analysis.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. What is TRIZEL</h2>
    
    <p>TRIZEL is a scientific ecosystem designed to maintain strict separation between governance authority, internal research operations, and public presentation functions. The system operates under a three-layer architectural model that enforces institutional boundaries and prevents conflation of roles.</p>
    
    <p>The name "TRIZEL" reflects this three-layer structure, with each layer having distinct responsibilities, authorities, and constraints. TRIZEL is not a single application or research tool, but rather an institutional framework for organizing scientific work under formal governance.</p>
    
    <p>TRIZEL establishes clear demarcation lines between policy-making, research execution, and public communication. This separation ensures that governance decisions remain independent of research outcomes, and that public presentation remains free from analytical authority.</p>

    <h2>2. Why TRIZEL Exists</h2>
    
    <p>TRIZEL exists to address the institutional challenge of maintaining separation of concerns in scientific ecosystems. Without formal boundaries, scientific systems often experience role conflation, where presentation interfaces gain unintended authority, or where research functions become entangled with governance decisions.</p>
    
    <p>The TRIZEL framework provides:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Governance Clarity:</strong> A single authoritative layer establishes policies and standards without involvement in research execution or public presentation.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Research Independence:</strong> Internal research operations proceed under governance constraints while remaining isolated from public-facing systems.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Presentation Integrity:</strong> Public presentation functions serve exclusively as display surfaces, with zero analytical or decision-making authority.</p>
    
    <p>This structure prevents scenarios where display systems inadvertently become sources of scientific truth, or where governance decisions become influenced by presentation concerns.</p>

    <h2>3. Layered Conceptual Architecture</h2>
    
    <p>The TRIZEL system operates under a strict three-layer separation model. Each layer has defined responsibilities and explicit constraints.</p>

    <div class="layer-box">
        <div class="layer-title">Layer-0: Governance and Authority</div>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Establishes policies, standards, and governance framework for the entire TRIZEL ecosystem.</p>
        <p><strong>Authority:</strong> Final and binding decision-making power for all system-wide policies.</p>
        <p><strong>Scope:</strong> Policy definition, governance documentation, layer separation rules, institutional standards.</p>
        <p><strong>Constraint:</strong> Layer-0 does not conduct research, execute analysis, or present public information. Its sole function is governance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="layer-box">
        <div class="layer-title">Layer-1: Internal Research and Analysis</div>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Conducts internal research, analysis, and technical execution under Layer-0 governance constraints.</p>
        <p><strong>Authority:</strong> Scientific and technical execution within the boundaries established by Layer-0.</p>
        <p><strong>Scope:</strong> Research projects, experiments, analysis pipelines, validation activities, research provenance, internal documentation.</p>
        <p><strong>Constraint:</strong> Layer-1 operations remain internal. Research findings do not automatically become public, and Layer-1 systems have no governance authority. All Layer-1 activities operate under Layer-0 policies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="layer-box">
        <div class="layer-title">Layer-2: Public Presentation and Display</div>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Provides public-facing presentation and orientation without any research or governance authority.</p>
        <p><strong>Authority:</strong> None. Layer-2 is exclusively a display surface.</p>
        <p><strong>Scope:</strong> Structural descriptions, navigation aids, frozen reference documentation, external resource references, institutional visual identity.</p>
        <p><strong>Constraint:</strong> Layer-2 has no scientific authority, conducts no research, makes no governance decisions, and performs no analysis. All content is static, snapshot-based, and governance-controlled.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>3.1 Layer Interaction Model</h3>
    
    <p>The three layers maintain strict separation:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Layer-0 to Layer-1:</strong> Layer-0 establishes policies and constraints that govern all Layer-1 research activities. Layer-1 operates within these boundaries but does not influence Layer-0 policies.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Layer-1 to Layer-2:</strong> Layer-1 research outputs may be frozen and published to Layer-2 as static documentation, but only through explicit governance approval. Layer-2 never accesses live Layer-1 data or systems.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Layer-0 to Layer-2:</strong> Layer-0 governs what content may appear in Layer-2 and under what constraints. Layer-2 has no reverse influence on Layer-0 governance.</p>
    
    <p>This unidirectional authority flow ensures that presentation concerns never influence research execution, and research outcomes never automatically influence governance policy.</p>

    <h2>4. Explicit Exclusions</h2>
    
    <p>TRIZEL explicitly does <strong>not</strong> perform the following functions:</p>

    <ul class="exclusion-list">
        <li><strong>TRIZEL is not a scientific publication platform.</strong> Layer-2 presentation materials are not intended for scientific citation. Research publications occur through formal peer-reviewed channels external to the TRIZEL ecosystem.</li>
        
        <li><strong>TRIZEL is not a data analysis service.</strong> Layer-2 has zero analytical capability. Layer-1 conducts internal analysis, but these functions are not exposed publicly.</li>
        
        <li><strong>TRIZEL is not a decision-making system.</strong> While Layer-0 establishes governance policies, TRIZEL does not make real-time operational decisions or automate governance choices.</li>
        
        <li><strong>TRIZEL is not a live data platform.</strong> Layer-2 presentation is strictly snapshot-based. No real-time data feeds, dashboards, or dynamic metrics appear in public-facing systems.</li>
        
        <li><strong>TRIZEL is not a collaborative research platform.</strong> Research collaboration occurs within Layer-1 under institutional control. Layer-2 does not provide collaborative tools or shared research infrastructure.</li>
        
        <li><strong>TRIZEL does not integrate external execution systems.</strong> Layer-2 presentation materials reference external resources but have no runtime integration, API connections, or data synchronization with external systems.</li>
        
        <li><strong>TRIZEL does not perform automated quality assurance.</strong> Validation and verification occur within Layer-1. Layer-2 has no quality assurance role.</li>
        
        <li><strong>TRIZEL does not generate scientific conclusions.</strong> Research conclusions are produced by Layer-1 research activities. Layer-2 may present frozen summaries but generates no original scientific interpretation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Scientific and Governance Positioning</h2>
    
    <p>TRIZEL positions itself as an institutional framework, not a research product. The system serves organizational and governance needs rather than scientific discovery needs.</p>

    <h3>5.1 Scientific Positioning</h3>
    
    <p>From a scientific perspective, TRIZEL is infrastructure. It provides the organizational structure for conducting research under formal governance, but it is not itself a contribution to scientific knowledge.</p>
    
    <p>Research conducted within Layer-1 of TRIZEL may produce scientific contributions, but those contributions are attributable to the research work itself, not to the TRIZEL framework. TRIZEL is the scaffolding, not the building.</p>
    
    <p>TRIZEL makes no scientific claims and holds no scientific authority. It does not validate hypotheses, interpret experimental results, or contribute to scientific discourse.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Governance Positioning</h3>
    
    <p>From a governance perspective, TRIZEL is a policy enforcement mechanism. Layer-0 establishes institutional policies, and the three-layer architecture ensures those policies are structurally enforced through separation of concerns.</p>
    
    <p>TRIZEL governance is institutional, not external. The governance framework applies within the TRIZEL ecosystem and does not extend authority beyond that scope.</p>
    
    <p>Governance decisions within TRIZEL are binding for TRIZEL-managed resources but have no regulatory or policy-making authority in broader institutional or scientific contexts.</p>

    <h3>5.3 Institutional Boundaries</h3>
    
    <p>TRIZEL operates within clear institutional boundaries. It does not claim ownership of scientific knowledge, does not regulate external research activities, and does not establish standards for institutions beyond its own scope.</p>
    
    <p>The TRIZEL framework is an internal organizational tool designed to maintain separation of concerns within a specific ecosystem. It is not a standard for others to adopt and makes no prescriptive claims about how other institutions should organize their scientific work.</p>

    <h2>6. Methodological Framework</h2>
    
    <p>TRIZEL employs a separation-of-concerns methodology across all three layers. This methodology emphasizes:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Explicit Role Assignment:</strong> Each layer has clearly defined responsibilities documented in governance materials. Roles do not overlap.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Structural Enforcement:</strong> Layer separation is enforced architecturally through repository isolation, access controls, and technical constraints rather than through procedural compliance alone.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Snapshot-Based Publication:</strong> Information flow from Layer-1 to Layer-2 occurs through discrete snapshots rather than continuous synchronization, ensuring that public presentation remains frozen and governance-controlled.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Fail-Closed Gating:</strong> Publication pathways require explicit human approval. Automated processes cannot bypass governance review.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Zero-Trust Presentation:</strong> Layer-2 has no assumed authority. All Layer-2 content carries institutional disclaimers clarifying its non-authoritative status.</p>
    
    <p>This methodological approach ensures that the three-layer model functions as intended, with structural guarantees preventing role conflation or authority leakage between layers.</p>

    <h2>7. Scope Boundaries</h2>
    
    <p>TRIZEL operates within the following scope boundaries:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Geographic Scope:</strong> None. TRIZEL is a digital organizational framework with no geographic constraints or territorial claims.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Temporal Scope:</strong> TRIZEL operates in the present institutional context. Historical research or future projections are the domain of Layer-1 research activities, not of the TRIZEL framework itself.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Disciplinary Scope:</strong> TRIZEL is methodology-agnostic. The three-layer model can accommodate research across disciplines without prescribing scientific methods or domain-specific practices.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Technical Scope:</strong> TRIZEL defines organizational structure but does not mandate specific technical implementations. Layer-1 research may employ any appropriate tools and technologies under Layer-0 governance constraints.</p>
