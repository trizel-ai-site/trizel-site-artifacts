## 1. Overview

This document defines the scope boundaries and methodological framework of the TRIZEL system. It establishes what TRIZEL encompasses, what it excludes, and how its three-layer architecture operates to maintain separation of concerns.

## 2. Scope Dimensions

### 2.1 Functional Scope

**What TRIZEL Encompasses:**

- Governance policy definition (Layer-0)
- Internal research execution (Layer-1)
- Public presentation and display (Layer-2)
- Layer separation enforcement mechanisms
- Institutional documentation and reference materials
- Snapshot-based publication pathways
- Formal review and approval processes

**What TRIZEL Excludes:**

- External regulatory authority
- Scientific publication platforms
- Real-time data processing or analytics
- Collaborative research infrastructure
- Automated decision-making systems
- Integration with external execution environments
- Dynamic dashboards or live metrics
- Scientific quality assurance or peer review

### 2.2 Geographic Scope

TRIZEL has no geographic boundaries or territorial constraints. The system operates as a digital organizational framework without geographic dependencies.

TRIZEL does not claim jurisdiction over physical locations, does not establish regional policies, and makes no geographic-specific governance decisions.

### 2.3 Temporal Scope

TRIZEL operates in the present institutional context. The framework does not:

- Make claims about historical research validity
- Predict future scientific outcomes
- Establish temporal milestones for external research
- Impose time-based constraints on Layer-1 research activities beyond institutional needs

Research conducted within Layer-1 may address historical or future-oriented questions, but the TRIZEL framework itself is temporally neutral.

### 2.4 Disciplinary Scope

TRIZEL is methodology-agnostic and discipline-neutral. The three-layer architecture accommodates research across all scientific disciplines without prescribing:

- Specific research methodologies
- Domain-specific best practices
- Disciplinary standards or conventions
- Scientific tools or technologies

Layer-0 governance may establish institutional policies that affect research practices, but these policies remain general and do not impose discipline-specific requirements.

### 2.5 Technical Scope

TRIZEL defines organizational structure but does not mandate specific technical implementations. The framework establishes:

- Layer separation requirements
- Governance approval mechanisms
- Presentation constraints for Layer-2
- Institutional integrity standards

Within these boundaries, Layer-1 research may employ any appropriate technical approaches, tools, or infrastructures that comply with Layer-0 governance policies.

## 3. Layer-Specific Scope Boundaries

### 3.1 Layer-0: Governance and Authority

**Scope:**

- Establish system-wide policies and standards
- Define layer separation rules and constraints
- Maintain authoritative governance documentation
- Provide final decision-making authority on institutional matters
- Approve publication pathways from Layer-1 to Layer-2

**Boundaries:**

- Does not conduct research or execute analysis
- Does not present public information or manage Layer-2 content
- Does not make scientific judgments or validate research findings
- Does not impose constraints beyond institutional scope

**Authority:** Final and binding within TRIZEL ecosystem; no external regulatory power.

### 3.2 Layer-1: Internal Research and Analysis

**Scope:**

- Execute research projects and experiments
- Conduct analysis and validation activities
- Maintain research provenance and documentation
- Archive research artifacts and outputs
- Operate internal tools and infrastructure

**Boundaries:**

- Operates under Layer-0 governance constraints
- Remains internal; does not automatically publish to Layer-2
- Has no governance authority; cannot modify Layer-0 policies
- Does not provide public-facing services or interfaces
- Does not integrate with Layer-2 presentation systems

**Authority:** Scientific and technical execution within Layer-0 boundaries.

### 3.3 Layer-2: Public Presentation and Display

**Scope:**

- Display structural information about TRIZEL
- Provide static documentation and reference materials
- Reference authoritative Layer-0 and Layer-1 sources (with disclaimers)
- Maintain institutional visual identity
- Present frozen snapshots of governance-approved content

**Boundaries:**

- Has no scientific authority or analytical capability
- Has no governance power or policy-making role
- Cannot execute code, process data, or perform analysis
- Cannot access live Layer-1 systems or data
- Cannot modify Layer-0 policies or Layer-1 research
- Presents only governance-approved static content

**Authority:** None — presentation-only display surface.

## 4. Methodological Framework

### 4.1 Separation of Concerns Methodology

TRIZEL employs strict separation of concerns across all three layers:

**Principle:** Each layer has singular, non-overlapping responsibilities.

**Implementation:**

- Repository isolation (separate Git repositories for each layer)
- Access controls (Layer-1 private; Layer-2 public; Layer-0 governance-controlled)
- Technical constraints (Layer-2 has no execution capability)
- Governance enforcement (all Layer-1 to Layer-2 publication requires approval)

**Outcome:** Roles remain distinct, preventing conflation of governance, research, and presentation functions.

### 4.2 Snapshot-Based Publication Methodology

TRIZEL uses discrete snapshots rather than continuous synchronization for Layer-1 to Layer-2 information flow:

**Principle:** Public presentation remains frozen and governance-controlled.

**Implementation:**

- Layer-1 produces research artifacts
- Governance review approves specific artifacts for publication
- Approved artifacts are frozen as static snapshots
- Snapshots are committed to Layer-2 repositories
- Layer-2 presents snapshots without modification

**Outcome:** Layer-2 never accesses live Layer-1 data; all public content is reviewed and frozen.

### 4.3 Fail-Closed Gating Methodology

TRIZEL employs fail-closed publication pathways:

**Principle:** Automated processes cannot bypass governance review.

**Implementation:**

- All Layer-1 to Layer-2 publication requires explicit human approval
- No automated synchronization or continuous deployment
- Default state is "closed" (no publication)
- Publication occurs only through deliberate governance action

**Outcome:** Governance maintains full control over what content becomes public.

### 4.4 Zero-Trust Presentation Methodology

TRIZEL assumes Layer-2 has no inherent authority:

**Principle:** Layer-2 materials carry institutional disclaimers clarifying non-authoritative status.

**Implementation:**

- All Layer-2 content includes classification notices
- Documentation explicitly states "no scientific authority"
- External references labeled "reference only — no integration"
- Interactive elements governed with strict boundaries

**Outcome:** Users understand that Layer-2 is a display surface, not a source of scientific truth.

### 4.5 Structural Enforcement Methodology

TRIZEL enforces layer separation architecturally, not just procedurally:

**Principle:** Technical constraints prevent layer boundary violations.

**Implementation:**

- Layer-2 repositories contain no execution code or analytical functions
- Access permissions prevent Layer-2 from modifying Layer-0 or Layer-1
- Publication pathways require cross-repository commits by authorized personnel
- Static site generators ensure Layer-2 content remains non-executable

**Outcome:** Compliance is structurally guaranteed, reducing reliance on procedural adherence.

## 5. Institutional Boundaries

### 5.1 Internal vs. External Authority

TRIZEL governance is internal to the TRIZEL ecosystem:

- Layer-0 establishes policies for TRIZEL-managed resources
- Governance decisions are binding within TRIZEL scope
- TRIZEL does not claim external regulatory authority
- TRIZEL does not establish standards for other institutions

### 5.2 Scientific Contribution vs. Infrastructure

TRIZEL positions itself as infrastructure, not as scientific contribution:

- Research conducted within Layer-1 may produce scientific contributions
- Those contributions are attributable to the research, not to TRIZEL
- TRIZEL provides organizational scaffolding for research
- TRIZEL itself makes no scientific claims or discoveries

### 5.3 Public Presentation vs. Scientific Publication

Layer-2 presentation is distinct from scientific publication:

- Layer-2 materials are not intended for scientific citation
- Research publications occur through peer-reviewed channels external to TRIZEL
- Layer-2 may reference published research but does not constitute publication
- Scientific discourse occurs in formal venues, not in Layer-2 presentation

## 6. Exclusions and Prohibitions

### 6.1 What TRIZEL Does NOT Do

TRIZEL explicitly does not:

1. **Perform peer review** — Quality assurance occurs within Layer-1; TRIZEL framework does not validate scientific claims
2. **Generate scientific conclusions** — Research conclusions are produced by Layer-1 research work, not by the organizational framework
3. **Integrate external execution systems** — Layer-2 references external resources but has no runtime integration
4. **Provide real-time data** — Layer-2 is snapshot-based with no live data feeds
5. **Make automated governance decisions** — Governance requires human review and approval
6. **Claim ownership of scientific knowledge** — Research contributions belong to researchers and institutions, not to TRIZEL
7. **Regulate external research** — TRIZEL governance applies only within TRIZEL scope
8. **Provide collaborative tools** — Collaboration occurs within Layer-1; Layer-2 has no collaborative infrastructure

### 6.2 Layer-2 Specific Prohibitions

Layer-2 presentation explicitly does NOT:

1. **Execute code** — No JavaScript execution, no server-side processing, no dynamic rendering (except minimal governance-approved UI elements)
2. **Perform analysis** — No data processing, computation, or analytical functions
3. **Access live systems** — No runtime connections to Layer-1 systems or external APIs
4. **Modify governance** — No ability to change Layer-0 policies or Layer-1 research
5. **Make scientific claims** — No authority to validate, interpret, or contribute to scientific knowledge
6. **Provide metrics** — No dashboards, analytics, or performance measurements
7. **Automate publication** — No continuous deployment or automated content updates

## 7. Compliance and Verification

### 7.1 Scope Compliance Mechanisms

TRIZEL ensures scope compliance through:

- **Repository structure** — Separate repositories for each layer prevent cross-contamination
- **Access controls** — Permissions enforce layer boundaries
- **Governance review** — Human approval required for cross-layer information flow
- **Static verification** — Layer-2 content is static and verifiable via Git history
- **Institutional audits** — Periodic review of compliance with scope boundaries

### 7.2 Verification Procedures

Stakeholders can verify TRIZEL scope compliance by:

1. Inspecting Layer-2 repository contents (all public and static)
2. Reviewing Git commit history (all changes tracked)
3. Examining governance approval records (documented in Layer-0)
4. Validating absence of execution code in Layer-2 repositories
5. Confirming external references are labeled "reference only — no integration"

## 8. Future Scope Evolution

### 8.1 Scope Modification Process

Changes to TRIZEL scope boundaries require:

1. Layer-0 governance proposal
2. Formal review and approval process
3. Documentation updates (including this SCOPE.md)
4. Stakeholder notification
5. Implementation under governance supervision

### 8.2 Scope Stability

TRIZEL scope boundaries are designed for long-term stability. The three-layer model and separation-of-concerns methodology are foundational principles that define the system's identity.

Incremental adjustments may occur within layers (e.g., new Layer-1 research tools, updated Layer-2 presentation formats), but the fundamental scope boundaries and layer separation model remain constant.
