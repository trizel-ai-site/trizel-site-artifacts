# TRIZEL Publication Policy

**Repository:** trizel-ai-site/trizel-site-artifacts  
**Document:** /scientific-publication/PUBLICATION_POLICY.md  
**Classification:** Institutional Governance Documentation  
**Authority:** Layer-0 Governance Framework  
**Status:** Active Publication Policy

## 1. Policy Overview

This document establishes the publication policy for the TRIZEL project. It defines how TRIZEL-governed research may be published externally, clarifies the relationship between TRIZEL framework documentation and scientific publication, and sets boundaries for what may appear on TRIZEL public-facing platforms.

## 2. Framework vs. Research Publication

### 2.1 Framework Documentation (This Website)

TRIZEL public-facing documentation, including this website (trizel-site-artifacts), contains **institutional framework documentation only**. This documentation describes:

- Organizational structure and governance frameworks
- Methodological principles and layer separation architecture
- Institutional policies and procedural guidelines
- Non-authoritative reference materials and orientation content

**Framework documentation is NOT scientific publication.** It makes no scientific claims, presents no research findings, and contributes no empirical knowledge to scientific literature.

### 2.2 Scientific Research (External Publication Only)

Any scientific research conducted under TRIZEL governance occurs within Layer-1 internal operations. Should such research produce scientifically significant results, those results:

- Will be prepared as formal scientific manuscripts
- Will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals, conferences, or other established scientific venues
- Will undergo external peer review according to venue standards
- Will be published externally first, before any reference appears on TRIZEL platforms
- Will be attributed to researchers and institutions, not to TRIZEL framework

**TRIZEL does not publish scientific research.** All research findings are published through traditional academic channels external to TRIZEL.

## 3. Publication Pathway for Scientific Research

### 3.1 Internal Development (Layer-1)

Research conducted under TRIZEL governance:

1. Occurs within Layer-1 private repositories and systems
2. Follows internal research protocols and validation procedures
3. Maintains research provenance and documentation standards
4. Remains internal until deemed suitable for external publication

### 3.2 External Publication Process

If research is deemed suitable for external publication:

1. **Manuscript Preparation:** Research findings are formatted according to target venue requirements
2. **Internal Review:** Layer-0 governance reviews manuscript for compliance with TRIZEL policies
3. **Submission:** Manuscript is submitted to external peer-reviewed venue
4. **Peer Review:** Manuscript undergoes standard external peer review process
5. **Revision and Acceptance:** Authors respond to reviewer feedback and revise as required
6. **External Publication:** Results are published in external venue (journal, conference, etc.)
7. **Optional Reference:** After external publication, TRIZEL platforms may reference the published work

**Critically:** External publication occurs before any public reference on TRIZEL platforms. This website never serves as the primary publication venue.

### 3.3 Post-Publication Reference

After research is published externally:

- TRIZEL platforms may include bibliographic references to published work
- References will include full citation information and links to external publications
- TRIZEL platforms will not reproduce full research findings or data
- TRIZEL platforms will not present unpublished analysis or results

## 4. What This Website May Contain

### 4.1 Permitted Content

This website (trizel-site-artifacts) may contain:

- Institutional governance documentation and policy statements
- Organizational structure descriptions and layer separation architecture
- Methodological framework explanations and conceptual models
- External references to published research (with full citations)
- Orientation materials for understanding TRIZEL structure
- Non-authoritative guidance documents and procedural descriptions

### 4.2 Prohibited Content

This website explicitly does NOT contain:

- Scientific research findings or empirical results
- Experimental data, measurements, or observations
- Performance metrics, benchmarks, or quantitative comparisons
- Unpublished analysis or research in progress
- Preprints, working papers, or unpublished manuscripts
- Statistical analysis or data visualizations
- Scientific claims, hypotheses, or theoretical contributions
- Research conclusions or interpretations of findings

## 5. Citation and Attribution

### 5.1 Framework Documentation

TRIZEL framework documentation (this website) is not intended for scientific citation. It is institutional material describing organizational structure, not research contribution.

**If citation is necessary for institutional reasons:**

- Cite this website as institutional documentation, not as research
- Use appropriate institutional citation format
- Clearly distinguish framework documentation from scientific publication
- Do not cite framework documentation as evidence for scientific claims

### 5.2 Scientific Research

Research conducted under TRIZEL governance and published externally should be cited according to the external publication venue:

- Cite the journal article, conference paper, or other external publication
- Attribute research to authors and their institutions
- Do not attribute research findings to TRIZEL framework
- TRIZEL framework is organizational infrastructure, not research contributor

## 6. Preprint and Working Paper Policy

### 6.1 No Preprint Status

TRIZEL public-facing platforms do not serve as preprint servers or working paper repositories. Materials on this website are institutional documentation, not unpublished scientific manuscripts.

### 6.2 External Preprint Servers

Researchers conducting work under TRIZEL governance may choose to deposit preprints on established preprint servers (e.g., arXiv, bioRxiv, SSRN) according to their disciplinary norms. Such deposits are external to TRIZEL and follow the policies of the preprint server.

TRIZEL framework neither prohibits nor requires preprint deposit. Researchers make preprint decisions based on their field's standards and publication strategies.

## 7. Open Access and Data Sharing

### 7.1 Open Access Publication

TRIZEL governance encourages open access publication when consistent with venue policies and funding requirements. Researchers are supported in pursuing open access options for their external publications.

### 7.2 Data Availability

Data availability follows the policies of external publication venues and applicable research standards. TRIZEL governance supports appropriate data sharing practices while maintaining institutional boundaries.

**Critically:** Data is not published on TRIZEL public-facing platforms. Data availability statements in external publications reference appropriate repositories external to TRIZEL.

## 8. Governance and Compliance

### 8.1 Layer-0 Authority

Publication decisions are governed by Layer-0 TRIZEL governance. Layer-0 reviews:

- Whether research is suitable for external publication
- Compliance with TRIZEL institutional policies
- Appropriate attribution and citation practices
- Maintenance of layer separation boundaries

### 8.2 Layer-1 Research Operations

Layer-1 conducts research and prepares manuscripts but does not make publication decisions independently. Publication requires Layer-0 approval.

### 8.3 Layer-2 Presentation Constraints

Layer-2 (this website) has no publication authority. It presents only governance-approved institutional documentation. Layer-2 never publishes scientific research.

## 9. Future Policy Evolution

This publication policy may be updated by Layer-0 governance as institutional needs evolve. Updates will be documented via Git commit history and announced through appropriate channels.

Policy modifications follow TRIZEL governance procedures and require formal approval.

## 10. Contact and Inquiries

For questions regarding publication policy:

- **Governance inquiries:** Refer to Layer-0 (trizel-core) governance documentation
- **Research publication questions:** Consult with Layer-1 research leadership
- **Framework documentation questions:** Refer to Layer-2 institutional materials

## Institutional Notice

This publication policy establishes governance frameworks and institutional boundaries. It contains no scientific data, no analytical results, and no unpublished research findings.

This policy is descriptive documentation, not a legal contract or binding external agreement.
