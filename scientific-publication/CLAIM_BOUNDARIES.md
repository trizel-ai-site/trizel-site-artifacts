## 1. Purpose

This document establishes explicit boundaries for what TRIZEL claims and what TRIZEL does not claim. It provides clear delineation to prevent misinterpretation of TRIZEL's scope, authority, and contributions.

## 2. Fundamental Position

**TRIZEL is a governance and methodological framework, not a scientific research contribution.**

TRIZEL provides organizational structure for managing research activities through layer separation architecture. TRIZEL itself makes no scientific claims, produces no research findings, and contributes no empirical knowledge.

## 3. What TRIZEL Claims

### 3.1 Organizational Structure

TRIZEL claims to provide:

- A three-layer separation architecture for organizing governance, research, and presentation functions
- Institutional policies and procedures for maintaining layer boundaries
- Documentation describing organizational structure and methodological principles

**Scope:** Organizational and procedural frameworks only. Not scientific methodology or research contributions.

### 3.2 Methodological Framework

TRIZEL claims to implement:

- Separation-of-concerns methodology for research organization
- Snapshot-based publication pathways to maintain governance control
- Fail-closed gating mechanisms for cross-layer information flow
- Structural enforcement of layer boundaries through repository architecture

**Scope:** Institutional governance approaches. Not scientific methods, experimental designs, or analytical techniques.

### 3.3 Institutional Boundaries

TRIZEL claims to maintain:

- Clear boundaries between governance (Layer-0), research (Layer-1), and presentation (Layer-2)
- Explicit constraints on what Layer-2 public-facing platforms may contain
- Governance-controlled approval processes for content publication

**Scope:** Internal organizational boundaries. Not external regulatory authority or scientific validation.

## 4. What TRIZEL Does NOT Claim

### 4.1 Scientific Authority

TRIZEL does NOT claim:

- Scientific expertise in any research domain
- Authority to validate scientific findings or methods
- Contribution to scientific knowledge or research literature
- Peer review capability or quality assurance for research
- Discovery of scientific facts or empirical phenomena

**Clarification:** Research conducted within TRIZEL governance may produce scientific contributions, but those contributions belong to the research and researchers, not to TRIZEL framework.

### 4.2 External Regulatory Authority

TRIZEL does NOT claim:

- Regulatory power over external institutions or researchers
- Authority to set standards for external research practices
- Jurisdiction over research conducted outside TRIZEL governance
- Enforcement capability beyond TRIZEL-managed resources

**Clarification:** TRIZEL governance applies only within TRIZEL-managed repositories, systems, and operations. It has no external regulatory scope.

### 4.3 Technical Innovation

TRIZEL does NOT claim:

- Novel algorithms, computational methods, or technical innovations
- Proprietary technologies or analytical techniques
- Software inventions or executable systems (within Layer-2)
- Technical superiority or performance advantages

**Clarification:** TRIZEL framework is organizational structure, not technical innovation. Any technical work occurs within Layer-1 research and is attributable to that research, not to TRIZEL framework.

### 4.4 Research Results

TRIZEL does NOT claim:

- Experimental findings or empirical results
- Statistical analysis or data-driven conclusions
- Performance metrics, benchmarks, or quantitative assessments
- Validated hypotheses or theoretical contributions
- Predictive models or analytical frameworks

**Clarification:** TRIZEL public-facing platforms (Layer-2) contain no research results. Research results, if produced within Layer-1, are published externally through peer-reviewed channels.

### 4.5 Scientific Publication Status

TRIZEL does NOT claim:

- Status as a scientific publication or research paper
- Peer review for framework documentation
- Contribution to scientific literature or research canon
- Citability as scientific evidence or authoritative source
- Preprint, working paper, or manuscript status

**Clarification:** TRIZEL framework documentation is institutional material describing organizational structure. It is not scientific publication and is not intended for scientific citation.

## 5. Scope Limitations

### 5.1 Geographic Scope

TRIZEL does NOT claim:

- Geographic jurisdiction or territorial authority
- Applicability to specific geographic regions
- Regional policy-making power

**Clarification:** TRIZEL operates as a digital organizational framework without geographic constraints or claims.

### 5.2 Temporal Scope

TRIZEL does NOT claim:

- Historical research validity or precedent
- Predictive power for future scientific outcomes
- Long-term scientific trajectory or roadmap

**Clarification:** TRIZEL framework operates in the present institutional context. It makes no claims about past or future research states.

### 5.3 Disciplinary Scope

TRIZEL does NOT claim:

- Expertise in any specific scientific discipline
- Disciplinary standards or best practices
- Domain-specific methodological authority

**Clarification:** TRIZEL is methodology-agnostic and discipline-neutral. It provides organizational structure applicable across disciplines but makes no disciplinary claims.

## 6. Authority Boundaries

### 6.1 Layer-0 (Governance)

Layer-0 claims authority to:

- Establish policies for TRIZEL-managed resources
- Approve content for publication on Layer-2 platforms
- Maintain governance documentation and institutional standards

Layer-0 does NOT claim:

- Scientific validation authority
- External regulatory power
- Research execution capability

### 6.2 Layer-1 (Research)

Layer-1 claims capability to:

- Conduct research under TRIZEL governance
- Execute analysis and validation activities
- Maintain research provenance and documentation

Layer-1 does NOT claim:

- Governance decision-making authority
- Public-facing presentation functions
- Automatic publication rights

**Note:** Layer-1 is not publicly accessible and makes no public claims.

### 6.3 Layer-2 (Presentation)

Layer-2 claims capability to:

- Present institutional documentation describing TRIZEL framework
- Display governance-approved static content
- Reference external authoritative sources

Layer-2 does NOT claim:

- Scientific authority or analytical capability
- Governance power or policy-making role
- Research execution or validation functions
- Access to live Layer-1 systems or data

**Clarification:** Layer-2 (this website) is a display surface only with zero authority.

## 7. Claim Verification

### 7.1 How Claims Are Verified

Claims about TRIZEL framework can be verified by:

- Inspecting public Layer-2 repositories (all content is public and static)
- Reviewing Git commit history (all changes are tracked)
- Examining governance documentation in Layer-0 (where accessible)
- Confirming absence of scientific content in Layer-2 repositories

### 7.2 What Cannot Be Verified

Because Layer-1 is internal and not publicly accessible:

- Internal research activities cannot be verified externally
- Research provenance and documentation are not public
- Unpublished analysis and findings are not available for inspection

**Clarification:** TRIZEL makes no public claims about Layer-1 research contents or findings. External verification is limited to public Layer-2 materials.

## 8. Misrepresentation Prevention

### 8.1 Common Misinterpretations

TRIZEL governance provides this document to prevent common misinterpretations:

**Misinterpretation:** "TRIZEL is a research platform or experimental system."  
**Clarification:** TRIZEL is organizational framework. Research occurs within Layer-1 under TRIZEL governance, but TRIZEL itself is not a research platform.

**Misinterpretation:** "TRIZEL publishes scientific results."  
**Clarification:** TRIZEL Layer-2 platforms contain institutional documentation only. Scientific results are published externally through peer-reviewed channels.

**Misinterpretation:** "TRIZEL claims scientific authority or expertise."  
**Clarification:** TRIZEL claims organizational structure capability only. Scientific authority resides in external research, researchers, and peer-reviewed publications.

**Misinterpretation:** "TRIZEL framework documentation is a scientific paper."  
**Clarification:** Framework documentation is institutional material describing organizational structure. It is not scientific publication.

### 8.2 Correction Process

If misrepresentation of TRIZEL claims is identified:

1. Refer to this CLAIM_BOUNDARIES.md document for clarification
2. Consult PUBLICATION_POLICY.md and CITATION_POLICY.md for additional context
3. Contact Layer-0 governance for authoritative clarification if needed

## 9. Future Research Attribution

### 9.1 Research Conducted Under TRIZEL Governance

Should research conducted within TRIZEL governance produce scientifically significant findings:

- Those findings are attributed to the research and researchers, not to TRIZEL framework
- TRIZEL framework claims no ownership of scientific discoveries
- Research contributions belong to authors, institutions, and funding sources

### 9.2 Framework vs. Research Contribution

**Framework contribution (TRIZEL):** Organizational structure and governance methodology  
**Research contribution (if any):** Scientific findings produced by research conducted under TRIZEL governance

These are distinct and separately attributable.

## 10. Disclaimer Integration

### 10.1 Relationship to Other Documentation

This CLAIM_BOUNDARIES.md document integrates with:

- **PUBLICATION_POLICY.md:** Defines publication pathways for external research
- **CITATION_POLICY.md:** Establishes citation rules and attribution guidelines
- **Framework documentation:** Describes organizational structure without scientific claims

All documents consistently maintain that TRIZEL framework makes no scientific claims.

### 10.2 Layer-2 Disclaimer Requirement

All Layer-2 public-facing materials must include disclaimers clarifying:

- No scientific authority
- No research results or findings
- Institutional documentation status only
- Non-citability as scientific literature

This CLAIM_BOUNDARIES.md document provides authoritative reference for disclaimer language.

## 11. Governance and Compliance
