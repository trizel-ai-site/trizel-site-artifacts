## 1. Citation Policy Overview

This document establishes citation rules and attribution guidelines for the TRIZEL project. It clarifies what materials are citable, how they should be cited, and the critical distinction between framework documentation and scientific research.

## 2. Fundamental Principle

**TRIZEL framework documentation is not intended for scientific citation.**

TRIZEL public-facing materials (this website and associated documentation) describe organizational structure and governance frameworks. They are institutional materials, not scientific contributions to research literature.

## 3. Framework Documentation Citation

### 3.1 When Framework Citation Is Appropriate

Citation of TRIZEL framework documentation may be appropriate in limited institutional contexts:

- Describing organizational models for research governance
- Referencing examples of layer separation architecture
- Discussing institutional approaches to separation of concerns
- Academic analysis of research organization methodologies

### 3.2 When Framework Citation Is Not Appropriate

TRIZEL framework documentation should NOT be cited:

- As evidence for scientific claims or empirical findings
- As authoritative sources for technical methods or algorithms
- As peer-reviewed scientific literature
- As research contributions to any scientific field
- In place of primary research literature

### 3.3 Recommended Framework Citation Format

If institutional citation of TRIZEL framework documentation is necessary:

**Plain Text:**
```
TRIZEL Project. (2026). [Document Title]. Retrieved from https://trizel-ai.org/[path]
```

**Example:**
```
TRIZEL Project. (2026). Scientific Publication Readiness Framework. Retrieved from https://trizel-ai.org/scientific-publication/
```

**Important Qualifications:**

When citing TRIZEL framework documentation, authors should:

1. Clearly identify the material as institutional documentation, not research publication
2. Distinguish framework documentation from scientific literature
3. Note that TRIZEL framework makes no scientific claims
4. Avoid implying that framework documentation has undergone peer review

## 4. Scientific Research Citation

### 4.1 Research Conducted Under TRIZEL Governance

Research conducted under TRIZEL governance and published in external peer-reviewed venues should be cited according to standard academic citation practices for that venue.

**Cite the external publication, not TRIZEL framework:**

- Journal articles: Use journal citation format
- Conference papers: Use conference citation format
- Preprints: Use preprint server citation format
- Technical reports: Use report citation format

### 4.2 Attribution

Research conducted under TRIZEL governance is attributed to:

- Individual researchers (authors)
- Their affiliated institutions (universities, research organizations)
- Funding sources (as appropriate)

**Research is NOT attributed to TRIZEL framework.** TRIZEL is organizational infrastructure, not a research contributor or author.

### 4.3 Acknowledgment

Researchers may choose to acknowledge TRIZEL governance framework in acknowledgment sections of publications if they consider it relevant to their research organization. Such acknowledgment is optional and at authors' discretion.

**Example acknowledgment language:**
```
"Research organization was conducted under TRIZEL governance framework."
```

Acknowledgment does not imply TRIZEL framework contributed to scientific findings. It simply notes the organizational context.

## 5. What Should NOT Be Cited

### 5.1 Layer-1 Internal Materials

Layer-1 internal research materials, documentation, and provenance records are not publicly accessible and should not be cited. Internal materials are not publication venues.

If research from Layer-1 is suitable for citation, it should be published externally first through peer-reviewed channels.

### 5.2 Unpublished Analysis

TRIZEL public-facing platforms contain no unpublished analysis, experimental results, or research findings. There is no unpublished scientific content to cite.

### 5.3 Preliminary or Working Research

TRIZEL does not publish preliminary findings, work-in-progress research, or unpublished working papers. Such materials, if they exist within Layer-1, remain internal until published externally.

## 6. Data Citation

### 6.1 No Data Publication on TRIZEL Platforms

TRIZEL public-facing platforms do not publish datasets, experimental measurements, or research data. Therefore, there are no TRIZEL-hosted datasets to cite.

### 6.2 External Data Repositories

If research conducted under TRIZEL governance produces datasets suitable for public sharing, those datasets should be deposited in appropriate external data repositories (e.g., Zenodo, figshare, domain-specific repositories).

Data citation follows the standards of the data repository, not TRIZEL framework.

## 7. Software and Code Citation

### 7.1 No Software Publication on TRIZEL Platforms

TRIZEL public-facing platforms (Layer-2) contain no executable software, algorithms, or analytical code. Layer-2 repositories are static documentation only.

### 7.2 Research Software

If research conducted under TRIZEL governance produces software suitable for public release, that software should be:

1. Deposited in appropriate code repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
2. Assigned appropriate identifiers (e.g., DOI via Zenodo)
3. Cited according to software citation standards

Software citation follows software citation principles (FORCE11 guidelines, etc.), not TRIZEL framework citation.

## 8. Version Control and Citability

### 8.1 Framework Documentation Versioning

TRIZEL framework documentation is version-controlled via Git. Specific versions can be referenced using:

- Git commit hashes
- Tagged releases (if applicable)
- Date of access (for web citations)

### 8.2 Stable Citation

Because framework documentation may evolve, citations should include:

- Date of access or retrieval
- Specific document version if available
- Full URL to cited material

This ensures citations remain accurate even if documentation is updated.

## 9. Persistent Identifiers

### 9.1 Current Status

TRIZEL framework documentation does not currently use persistent identifiers (e.g., DOI) because it is institutional documentation, not research publication.

### 9.2 Future Consideration

Should TRIZEL framework documentation require persistent identifiers for institutional archiving purposes, Layer-0 governance may assign appropriate identifiers. Such identifiers would be for archival purposes, not to confer research publication status.

## 10. Citation Integrity

### 10.1 Accuracy

Citations of TRIZEL materials must accurately represent:

- The type of material (institutional documentation, not research)
- The content and scope of cited documents
- The lack of peer review for framework documentation
- The distinction between framework and scientific research

### 10.2 Misrepresentation

It is inappropriate to:

- Cite TRIZEL framework as peer-reviewed research
- Present framework documentation as scientific findings
- Imply TRIZEL framework makes empirical claims
- Use framework citations in place of primary scientific literature

## 11. Retraction and Correction Policy

### 11.1 Framework Documentation

TRIZEL framework documentation may be corrected or updated via standard version control processes. Significant changes are documented in Git commit history.

Framework documentation updates do not follow retraction procedures because framework documentation is not research publication.

### 11.2 External Research Publications

If research conducted under TRIZEL governance and published externally requires correction or retraction, those processes follow the policies of the external publication venue.

TRIZEL governance supports appropriate correction and retraction practices but does not manage external publication venues.

## 12. Copyright and Licensing

### 12.1 Framework Documentation

TRIZEL framework documentation is publicly accessible institutional material. Specific licensing terms, if any, are stated in repository documentation.

Citation of framework documentation should respect any applicable licensing terms.

### 12.2 Research Publications

Copyright and licensing for research conducted under TRIZEL governance and published externally follow the policies of external publication venues and applicable institutional agreements.

## 13. Compliance and Governance

### 13.1 Layer-0 Authority

Citation policy is governed by Layer-0 TRIZEL governance. Policy updates require Layer-0 approval.

### 13.2 Enforcement

TRIZEL governance cannot enforce citation practices in external publications. This policy provides guidance and recommendations for appropriate citation.

Researchers and authors retain responsibility for accurate and appropriate citation in their publications.

## 14. Future Policy Updates

This citation policy may be updated by Layer-0 governance as institutional needs evolve or citation standards change. Updates will be documented via Git commit history.

Policy modifications follow TRIZEL governance procedures.

## 15. Contact and Inquiries

For questions regarding citation policy:

- **Framework citation questions:** Refer to this document and Layer-2 institutional materials
- **Research citation questions:** Follow standards of external publication venues
- **Governance inquiries:** Refer to Layer-0 (trizel-core) governance documentation
