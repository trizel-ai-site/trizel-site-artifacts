# GOVERNANCE PHASE E LOCK

**Repository:** trizel-ai-site/trizel-site-artifacts  
**Status:** PHASE E ACTIVE AND FROZEN  
**Authority:** Layer-0 Governance (trizel-core)  
**Date:** 2026-01-21  

> **Note:** This document provides explicit governance hardening and Phase F prohibition details. For the complete Phase E framework and operational guidelines, see [PHASE_E_DECLARATION.md](PHASE_E_DECLARATION.md).

## PHASE E: ACTIVE AND FROZEN

This repository is under **PHASE E LOCKDOWN**. Phase E is the designated governance mode for this repository, representing a hard freeze on all execution, analysis, and interactive capabilities.

### Phase E Declaration

**Phase E is ACTIVE and FROZEN:**
- ✅ **Read-Only** — All content is static, no live data
- ✅ **Snapshot-Based** — All artifacts are frozen references
- ✅ **Governance-Controlled** — All updates require Layer-0 approval
- ✅ **Display Only** — No execution, no analysis, no integration

This is **NOT** a temporary state. Phase E is the **permanent operational mode** for this repository under current governance.

---

## PHASE F: EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED

**Phase F is NOT AUTHORIZED for this repository.**

### What is Phase F?

Phase F would represent an evolution beyond Phase E that would include interactive and dynamic capabilities. While Phase E (as defined in [PHASE_E_DECLARATION.md](PHASE_E_DECLARATION.md)) is strictly read-only and static, Phase F would introduce:
- Interactive dashboards
- Live data visualization
- Real-time analytics
- Dynamic data exploration
- Automated data pipelines
- Active monitoring interfaces

These capabilities are **explicitly forbidden** under current governance.

### Why Phase F is Prohibited

1. **Governance Authority** — Phase F exceeds Layer-2 presentation authority
2. **Scope Violation** — Interactive features violate Phase E read-only constraints
3. **Data Requirements** — Phase F would require live data access (prohibited)
4. **Execution Risk** — Phase F implies analysis capability (not authorized)

### Phase F Authorization Requirements

Phase F may **ONLY** be activated by:
- **Explicit Layer-0 decision** documented in trizel-core
- **Formal governance amendment** changing repository classification
- **Written authorization** from TRIZEL governance authority

**NO technical, editorial, or procedural bypass is permitted.**

Without explicit Layer-0 authorization documented in trizel-core, any attempt to implement Phase F features constitutes a governance violation.

## EXPLICIT WARNING: PHASE F IS NOT AUTHORIZED

⚠️ **WARNING TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS:**

The following activities are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** and constitute Phase F violations:

1. **Dashboard Implementation**
   - No charts or graphs beyond static images
   - No interactive data visualizations
   - No real-time metrics display
   - No dynamic rendering of data

2. **Live Data Integration**
   - No API calls to external data sources
   - No database connections
   - No automated data fetching
   - No real-time updates

3. **Analytics Features**
   - No user behavior tracking
   - No metrics collection
   - No A/B testing
   - No data analysis tools

4. **Interactive Components**
   - No user input forms (except language selection)
   - No dynamic content updates

   - No progressive enhancement beyond accessibility

5. **Automation Pipelines**

## NO-BYPASS CLAUSE

### Technical Bypass — PROHIBITED

- No backdoor implementation of Phase F features
- No "experimental" or "prototype" Phase F code
- No Phase F features disguised as "enhancements"
- No gradual scope creep toward Phase F capabilities

### Editorial Bypass — PROHIBITED

- No Phase F features justified as "documentation"
- No Phase F content under alternative naming
- No Phase F capabilities labeled as "Phase E extensions"
- No redefining Phase E boundaries to include Phase F

### Procedural Bypass — PROHIBITED

- No emergency Phase F deployments
- No temporary Phase F exceptions
- No pilot Phase F programs
- No Phase F "trials" or "tests"

### Enforcement

All PRs are subject to:
- **Governance review** — Layer-0 approval for scope changes
- **Manual verification** — Phase E boundary verification during review
- **Explicit rejection** — Phase F proposals rejected on sight

**There are NO exceptions to this governance lock.**

## GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY

### Layer-0 Supremacy

Only Layer-0 (trizel-core) has authority to:
- Modify this governance lock
- Authorize Phase F activation
- Change repository classification
- Override Phase E constraints

### Layer-2 Constraints

This repository (Layer-2) has:
- **NO authority** to self-authorize Phase F
- **NO discretion** to interpret Phase E boundaries flexibly
- **NO power** to implement "lightweight" Phase F features
- **NO ability** to bypass governance requirements

### Approval Chain

For any Phase F proposal:
1. **Proposal must originate** from Layer-0 (trizel-core)
2. **Written authorization required** in governance documentation
3. **Repository reclassification needed** (Phase E → Phase F)
4. **Explicit governance amendment** documented and approved

**Anything less than full Layer-0 authorization is insufficient.**

---

## COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

### Current State

- ✅ Phase E fully implemented
- ✅ No Phase F features present
- ✅ Read-only constraints enforced
- ✅ Governance notices in place

### Ongoing Monitoring

Regular audits verify:
- No Phase F code introduced
- No scope creep beyond Phase E
- No governance violations
- No unauthorized automation

### Violation Response

If Phase F features are detected:
1. **Immediate rollback** to compliant state
2. **PR rejection** with governance notice
3. **Contributor notification** of violation
4. **Documentation update** if boundaries unclear

## SUMMARY

**Phase E:** ACTIVE AND FROZEN — This is the permanent state  
**Phase F:** EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED — Not authorized for this repository  
**Authorization:** Layer-0 ONLY — No bypass permitted  
**Compliance:** MANDATORY — No exceptions

This governance lock is **non-negotiable** and enforced under Layer-0 authority.
