# Snapshots — Registry

[← Back to GOI Home](../../index.en.md)

## Purpose

The Snapshots Registry catalogs frozen reference bundles with integrity verification. Snapshots are point-in-time captures of data, analysis, or system states that serve as permanent reference artifacts.

## Registry Table

| Snapshot_ID | Date_Frozen | Scope | Contents | Status | Integrity |
|-------------|-------------|-------|----------|--------|-----------|
| *No published entries yet* | — | — | — | — | — |

## Data Source

This page displays data from: `/goi/data/global-index.json`

**Current Status:** No snapshots have been published yet. This registry will be populated as frozen reference bundles are created and their metadata is committed to this repository.

## Snapshot Types

Snapshots may include:
- **Data Snapshots** — Frozen datasets at specific points in time
- **Analysis Snapshots** — Preserved analysis results and methodologies
- **System State Snapshots** — Complete system configurations and states
- **Archive Bundles** — Curated collections of related artifacts
- **Reference Releases** — Versioned reference data products

## Integrity Verification

Each snapshot entry includes:
- **Snapshot ID:** Unique identifier for the snapshot
- **Date Frozen:** Timestamp when the snapshot was created
- **Scope:** Description of what is included
- **Contents:** Detailed inventory of snapshot contents
- **Status:** Current status (frozen, verified, archived)
- **Integrity:** Hash or checksum for verification

## Verification Methods

Snapshots can be verified through:
1. Git commit history showing when metadata was added
2. Integrity hashes (SHA-256 or equivalent)
3. Provenance tracking through source references
4. Timestamp records
