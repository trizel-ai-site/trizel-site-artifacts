# Production — Ledger

[← Back to GOI Home](../../index.en.md)

## Purpose

The Production Ledger tracks scientific outputs and analysis results produced by the TRIZEL ecosystem. This section provides a static record of production outputs including their type, source, associated snapshots, and status.

## Ledger Table

| Output_ID | Type | Source Repo | Snapshot_ID | Date | Status |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------------|------|--------|
| *No published entries yet* | — | — | — | — | — |

## Data Source

This page displays data from: `/goi/data/global-index.json`

**Current Status:** No production outputs have been published yet. This ledger will be populated as scientific outputs are produced and their metadata is committed to this repository.

## Production Types

Production outputs may include:
- **Analysis Results** — Scientific analysis and derived data products
- **Processed Datasets** — Cleaned, transformed, or aggregated data
- **Reports** — Summary reports and documentation
- **Visualizations** — Charts, plots, and graphical representations
- **Derived Products** — Secondary data products created from primary observations

## Verification

All production entries are verifiable through:
1. Git commit history in this repository
2. Snapshot references for provenance tracking
3. Source repository attribution
4. Timestamp records
